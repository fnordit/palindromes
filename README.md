# palindromes
Generates n-word palindromes from the dictionary

Usage: python main.py [dict] [length]

dict should be a file with one word per line, such as /user/share/cracklib/cracklib-small if you use cracklib as your 
dictionary

Trie.py is a radix tree - considering putting it in its own repo, as it's effectively a stand alone library
